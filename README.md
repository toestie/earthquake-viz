# Earthquake Visualization
by Nathan Wong

The goal of this project is to create an online dashboard for visualizing recent earthquakes around the world, primarily using data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey). 

### Data Sources:
* http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
* https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates

### Sample Screenshots:

The following are a few images of the website (I originally made a Heroku app to deploy this website without revealing the API key; unfortunately I no longer pay for that service). Here are screencaps of the website and how the data is visualized upon clicking on the earthquake marker:
